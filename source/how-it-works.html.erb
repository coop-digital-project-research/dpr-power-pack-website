      <h2>Power Pack brings local renewable energy producers and consumers together</h2>
      <p><strong>Power Pack</strong> is a new way for communities to buy renewable energy from local producers at a better price for everyone.</p>
      <p>
        More and more people are putting solar panels and wind turbines on their homes, businesses and community buildings. But renewable energy generation is variable.
      </p>
      <p>
        Often the solar panels and turbines make more energy than the people who own them can use. And there is no cheap way to store this energy.
      </p>
      <p>
        So they sell it back to to the National Grid at a low price. Meanwhile their neighbours are paying 2 to 3 times more to buy it back off the National Grid again.
      </p>
      <p>
        Power Pack makes it easy to buy excess energy from your neighbours. It's a local energy sharing club with a better price for everyone.
      </p>
      <p>
        A commitment to Power Pack will lead to a whole new way to generate and sell electricity in the UK.
      </p>
